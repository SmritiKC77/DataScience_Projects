I have done 4 projects in this repository:
1. Sales prediction based on ads: This project revolves around forecasting sales influenced by advertisements, primarily focusing on TV ads. Utilizing Linear Regression, I developed a predictive model to estimate sales figures. Additionally, I constructed a Streamlit application to streamline the prediction process. Employing feature selection techniques, I experimented with both single and multiple features to enhance prediction accuracy. Further analysis involved the implementation of various regression techniques, including Lasso and Ridge regression. To assess model performance, I evaluated metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and r2 score, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the predictive capabilities of the models.
2. Diabetes prediction: In this project, I employed machine learning algorithms to categorize diabetes cases. I explored the effectiveness of both Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Logistic Regression models, ultimately determining that Logistic Regression outperformed SVC for our dataset. My approach involved comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key features, followed by rigorous data cleaning and feature engineering processes. Implementation of the SVC and Logistic Regression models was coupled with meticulous evaluation using metrics such as recall score, precision score, F1 score, and confusion matrix analysis, ensuring a thorough assessment of model performance.
3. Handling missing data in hr dataset:In the HR dataset (hr.csv), I conducted essential tasks such as feature selection and data cleansing to prepare the data for analysis. I then applied two machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression and SVC, and compared their performance. Evaluation was performed using metrics including F1 score, recall score, precision score, and confusion matrix analysis. To address missing data, I employed methods such as deletion and mode replacement. Through this process, I determined that SVC emerged as the superior model based on the evaluation criteria.
4. Water potability: In the water potability test project, I employed Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithms to assess water quality. Despite limited feature correlation, I proceeded with feature selection and retained all features for analysis. As part of preprocessing, I applied scaling using StandardScaler. The models underwent evaluation based on metrics such as F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy. Ultimately, SVC outperformed Gaussian Naive Bayes in this dataset analysis.
